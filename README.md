Detailed Analysis and Key Insights

1. Sales Performance Trends
The sales trend fluctuates throughout the year, with the highest sales recorded in June (57,208 units) and the lowest in October (47,432 units).
A notable increase in sales occurs between February and March, peaking in June, followed by a gradual decline.
Seasonal demand might be influencing sales patterns, potentially driven by weather conditions, festive periods, or marketing campaigns.

2. Best-Selling Coffee Products
Colombian coffee leads in total sales (144,776 units), followed by Costa Rican (141,078 units) and Ethiopian (134,154 units) coffee.
Colombian coffee also received the highest discounts (18,104 units), indicating a potential correlation between discounts and sales volume.
Despite having the lowest discounts, Brazilian coffee (102,834 units sold) still performed well, suggesting brand loyalty or a strong customer preference.

3. Customer Behavior and Discounts
A large portion of customers received discounts, as indicated in the customer discount distribution.
Discounts significantly influenced sales volume, especially for Colombian coffee.
The top five customers contributed significantly to revenue, with the highest spender (Customer ID 2), purchasing 14,334 units.

4. Sales Distribution by City
Hail recorded the highest sales (77,257 units), followed by Jeddah (72,048 units) and Riyadh (68,421 units).
The presence of key metropolitan cities like Riyadh and Jeddah in the top rankings indicates a strong urban demand.
Tabuk had the lowest sales among the top-performing cities (51,019 units), suggesting potential for growth.

5. Coffee Pricing Insights
Ethiopian coffee has the highest average price ($45 per unit), while Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Colombian coffee are priced slightly lower ($35–$40 per unit).
Higher-priced coffee types like Ethiopian might appeal to premium customers but could be limiting their sales volume compared to more affordable alternatives.

Recommendations

1. Optimize Discount Strategies  
Discounts have a clear impact on sales, as seen with Colombian coffee. Applying targeted discounts during low-sales months (such as October) can help maintain steady demand.  
   
2. Expand Sales in Lower-Performing Cities
Cities like Tabuk and Abha, which recorded relatively lower sales, could benefit from focused marketing campaigns or new distribution strategies to increase reach and consumer engagement.

3. Capitalize on Seasonal Peaks 
Sales peak in June; businesses should leverage this by launching promotional campaigns, bundling offers, and ensuring high stock availability during this period.

4. Diversify Product Offerings 
Ethiopian coffee, despite having a high price point, performs well. Introducing premium versions of other coffee types might attract high-end consumers.

5. Customer Retention Focus  
The top customers significantly contribute to total revenue. Implementing loyalty programs or exclusive offers for repeat buyers could enhance customer retention.

6. Urban Market Expansion  
Major cities like Jeddah and Riyadh exhibit strong demand. Expanding premium coffee availability in these locations could further boost revenue.
